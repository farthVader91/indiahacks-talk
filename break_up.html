<pre>Diff between concurrency and parallelism:
=========================================</pre>
</h3>
Duration: 2 min
    Concurrency is a technique, where the problem is decomposed into
    sub-components that can be executed in an arbitrary order but still get deterministic
    results.
    These units of computation can execute on one or more
    While they are not the same, they are not mutually exclusive either. Parallelism is a
    technique using which, concurrency can be achieved.
    There are a myriad of techniques that we can employ to achieve concurrency. B


<h3>
<pre>Scheduling Primer:
==================</pre>
</h3>

<ul>
    <li><p>Schedule computational elements(such as threads, processes, etc) onto hardware
    resources(such as processors, network links, etc).<br/>
        (explain briefly about ready queue)
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Long term scheduler:<br/>
        aka Job Scheduler. Determines which jobs are to be pushed
        onto Ready Queue(in main memory) and loads them.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Medium term scheduler:<br/>
        Responsible for swapping processes from main memory and
        placing them in secondary storage.
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Short term scheduler:<br/>
        aka CPU scheduler. Allocates CPU to processes from Ready Queue.
        Happens during interrupts(clock, i/o), system calls, signals. Hence more frequent.

    </p></li>
    <li><p>Wall-clock time, User-CPU time, CPU time:<br/>
        User-CPU time + Kernel Time(system calls)
    </p></li>
    <li><p>Pre-emptive vs co-op:<br/>
        <ul>
            <li>highlight overhead of pre-emptive scheduling, and where it's applicable</li>
            <li>Mention that kernel threads are pre-emptively scheduled</li>
        </ul>

Concurrency features in Python:
===============================

    Categorize features as event-driven, coroutine based, underlying library(s) used, etc.

> Threading:
    2 Python threads cannot run at the same time, i.e they cannot be scheduled across cores.
    This is because of the GIL, which restricts only Python thread to running bytecode at
    any point in time.
